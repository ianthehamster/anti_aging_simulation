# ðŸ§¬ Cellular Aging Simulation

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [Click here to try the simulation on Streamlit](https://antiagingsimulation.streamlit.app/)

This project simulates **telomere shortening** in cell DNA based on **stress level** using Python.

It measures the **telomere length** over the number of **cell divisions** and plots the following 3 graphs:

1. **Telomere Shortening Over Time With a Stress Level of 2.6 as a 2D chart**
2. **Telomere Shortening Over Time With a Stress Level of 2.6 as a 3D Scatter Plot**
3. **3 cell states over 50 cell division cycles as a 2D chart**

The graphs show how **oxidative stress levels** influence the telomere length as well as the health state of the multi-cellular organism.

Use the **slider** to adjust the oxidative stress level concentrations in the cells.
